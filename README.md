# disease-propagation
Explicit simulation to model the spread of disease in a population, using C++ and Python. Midterm/final project for UTexas SDS 322 Spring 2024.

## Project Roadmap
* **(done)** Model the infection and recovery of an isolated individual, with a given chance of contracting infection and a set number of days until recovery.
* Build a population of individuals, with a fixed number of contacts and probability of transmission, to see how adjustments to these variables changes the rate of spread through the community.
* Introduce a vaccine to a set percentage of the population to observe the effects of herd immunity on the number of individuals infected and the time it takes for the infection to spread through the population.
* Create graphical representations of the experimental data.
